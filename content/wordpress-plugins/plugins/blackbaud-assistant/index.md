# Plugin Assistant

## What it does

While the Plugin Assistant is technically a WordPress plugin, it doesn't really do much by itself. It's more or less a collection of methods that all of Blackbaud's official plugins use.

<p class="alert alert-info">All of Blackbaud's offial plugins require that the Plugin Assistant is also installed on the same site.</p>

## How to install

Read through the <a href="../../getting-started/">Getting Started</a> section for installation instructions.

## Setup

The Plugin Assistant does not have any configuration options.
