# Getting Started

All of Blackbaud's WordPress plugins require the _Plugin Assistant_. The Plugin Assistant is a WordPress plugin by definition, but it doesn't do much by itself. It simply creates a framework on which the other plugins are built upon. The Plugin Assistant is also responsible for linking each plugin to the auto-update service, among other things.

## Dependencies

- PHP version 5.3.0 or greater
- WordPress version 4.3.1 or greater
- FTP or WordPress admin credentials

## Installing the Plugin Assistant

The Plugin Assistant is installed like any other WordPress plugin.
