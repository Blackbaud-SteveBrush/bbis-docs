# Contributing to Blackbaud's WordPress Plugins

## GitHub

The source files for Blackbaud's official plugins are located in the <a href="https://github.com/convio/GMBU&#95;Interactive&#95;Services/tree/master/packages/wp-plugins" target="_blank">GMBU&#95;Interactive_Services repository on GitHub</a>. If you do not have permission to access this repository, please provide your GitHub handle (or username) to <a href="mailto:andrew.fort@blackbaud.com">Andrew Fort</a> or <a href="mailto:jason.rikard@blackbaud.com">Jason Rikard</a> so they may add you to the list of contributors.

Currently, the process flow for updates mostly looks like the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow" target="_blank">Feature Branch Workflow</a>. In other words, all collaborators have a duplicate of the repository on their local machines and open Pull Requests to the master branch for updates. The owner of the master branch will then review the pull request and decide whether or not it should be merged.

## Things to note

When making a change to the Plugin Assistant, double-check that this change will not affect the other plugins in a negative way. Remember, all of Blackbaud's official plugins use the classes and features in the Plugin Assistant, so having all plugins installed on your local machine for testing is desired.
